# OpenWrt X30 Builder

Automated OpenWrt builds for the **TOTOLINK X30** router on the MediaTek Filogic target.

This repository builds a custom OpenWrt image for the X30 by combining:

- the official OpenWrt stable branch
- a pinned TOTOLINK X30 board-support patch
- a reproducible GitHub Actions workflow
- a minimal device-specific OpenWrt configuration

The goal is to produce updateable `sysupgrade.bin` images without manually compiling OpenWrt on a local machine.

## Target device

Device:

```text

## Built-in packages
